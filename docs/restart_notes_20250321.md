# Restart Notes - March 21, 2025

## Current Project Status

The SMITE 2 CombatLog Parser is a comprehensive SDK for parsing and analyzing SMITE 2 CombatLog files. The project aims to provide structured data access, performance metrics calculation, and visualization capabilities for MOBA game analysis.

### Key Components

- **Core Parser**: Transforms raw CombatLog JSON into structured DataFrames
- **Analytics Framework**: Modular framework for calculating various game metrics
- **PerformanceAnalyzer**: Calculates KDA, damage, healing, and economy metrics
- **Visualization Tools**: Creates charts and visualizations from analysis results

### Recent Accomplishments (March 24, 2025)

1. **Fixed Example Scripts**:
   - Fixed `performance_analysis.py` with proper column mapping
   - Fixed `enhanced_performance_visualization.py` with matplotlib corrections
   - Both example scripts now run successfully with visualizations

2. **Enhanced Defensive Programming**:
   - Implemented `ColumnMapper` utility in `src/utils/data_validation.py`
   - Added robust handling for missing columns and inconsistent naming
   - Improved error handling throughout the SDK

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation
   - Added detailed API reference and examples
   - Documented DataFrame schemas and utility methods

## Current Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

1. **Parser Layer**: `CombatLogParser` transforms raw logs into structured data
2. **Analytics Layer**: Modular analyzers extract insights from parsed data
3. **Visualization Layer**: Creates visual representations of analytical results
4. **SDK Utilities**: Common utilities for data validation, error handling, etc.

We're transitioning to a more SDK-centric architecture where core functionality and validation happens in the SDK rather than in the UI layer.

## Known Issues

1. **Column Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - `get_enhanced_combat_dataframe()` returns columns like `source_type` and `target_type`
   - PerformanceAnalyzer expects columns like `source_entity_type` and `target_entity_type`
   - We've implemented the `ColumnMapper` utility to address this, but not all methods use it yet

2. **Visualization Errors**:
   - Fixed matplotlib configuration issues in ThemeManager
   - Still need to standardize visualization approach across SDK

3. **Defensive Programming**:
   - Improved in key components, but not uniformly applied throughout the codebase
   - More validation needed in analyzer methods

## Next Steps

1. **SDK-Centric Architecture Implementation** (Highest Priority):
   - Continue integrating `ColumnMapper` throughout all analyzer methods
   - Implement standard validation approach for analyzer inputs/outputs
   - Move chart generation logic into the SDK core

2. **Expand PerformanceAnalyzer**:
   - Complete integration of ColumnMapper in all methods
   - Add more advanced metrics (role-specific benchmarking)
   - Improve error handling and reporting

3. **Streamlit Dashboard Enhancement**:
   - Update to use improved SDK interfaces
   - Add export functionality
   - Create comprehensive testing

   - `agent_notes/notebook.md` - Detailed notes on data structure and implementation
   - `agent_notes/project_checklist.md` - Current progress and next steps

2. **Core Implementation**:
   - `src/parser.py` - Core parsing functionality
   - `src/analytics/performance.py` - PerformanceAnalyzer implementation
   - `src/utils/data_validation.py` - New ColumnMapper utility

3. **Example Scripts**:
   - `examples/performance_analysis.py` - Basic performance analysis example
   - `examples/enhanced_performance_visualization.py` - Enhanced visualization example

## Quick Setup for Testing

To quickly test the current state:

```bash
# Run basic performance analysis example
python3 examples/performance_analysis.py

# Run enhanced visualization example
python3 examples/enhanced_performance_visualization.py

# Run test suite
python run_tests.py
```

## Notes on Recent Changes

We've been implementing a more robust and consistent approach to handling DataFrame column mapping, which is critical to the project's stability. The `ColumnMapper` utility was introduced to standardize column names and ensure required columns exist, preventing KeyErrors and providing more meaningful error messages.

Key PerformanceAnalyzer methods have been updated to use this utility, but some methods still need to be updated. This should be the immediate focus when work resumes.
