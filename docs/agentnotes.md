# SMITE 2 CombatLog Parser Project Notes

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive analytics framework for SMITE 2 CombatLog data, transforming raw logs into structured formats suitable for advanced MOBA game analysis. The project includes a core parser, modular analytics framework, and planned Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Parser (COMPLETED)
We've implemented a robust parser that transforms raw CombatLog JSON data into structured dataframes:
- Core data models in `src/models.py`
- Utility functions in `src/utils.py`
- Parser class in `src/parser.py`
- Entity classification into Players, Objectives, Jungle Camps, Minions, etc.

### Phase 2: Analytics Framework (COMPLETED)
We've implemented a modular analytics framework that builds on the core parser:
- Created `src/analytics/` module with base abstract class
- Implemented BaseAnalyzer with caching and configuration system
- Developed PerformanceAnalyzer for player performance metrics:
  - KDA (Kills, Deaths, Assists) calculations
  - Damage statistics (player damage, objective damage, etc.)
  - Healing metrics (self-healing, ally healing)
  - Economy stats (gold, XP) with source breakdowns
  - Efficiency metrics (damage efficiency, DPM)

### Phase 3: End-to-End Analyzer Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
We're now taking a more integrated approach to implementing analyzers:
- For each analyzer, we will complete the full development cycle:
  1. Core analyzer implementation with metrics
  2. Visualization framework for the analyzer
  3. Streamlit dashboard integration
- This approach allows us to deliver complete, usable features incrementally
- The first analyzer to receive this treatment is the PerformanceAnalyzer

### Phase 4: Performance Analyzer Enhancement (PLANNED)
We're extending the PerformanceAnalyzer with:
- Advanced efficiency metrics:
  - Damage efficiency (damage per gold spent)
  - Gold efficiency (gold per minute)
  - Combat contribution (% of team damage)
  - Survival efficiency ((K+A)/D with weighting)
  - Target prioritization metrics
- Comparative analytics:
  - Performance vs. match average
  - Role-specific benchmarks
  - Team contribution percentages
- Comprehensive visualizations:
  - KDA comparison charts
  - Damage distribution visualizations
  - Gold and economy tracking
  - Performance overview radar charts

### Phase 5: Streamlit Dashboard Development (PLANNED)
We're creating a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard:
- Upload and analyze CombatLog files
- Interactive visualizations for all analytics modules
- Comparative analysis between players, roles, and teams
- Time-based filtering and drill-down capabilities
- Export options for reports and visualizations

4. Enhance PerformanceAnalyzer with advanced metrics
5. Create visualization framework and performance visualizations
6. Implement Streamlit dashboard for performance analysis
7. Move to FarmAnalyzer implementation following the same pattern

## Technical Decisions
- We're taking an end-to-end approach for each analyzer before moving to the next
- This allows us to deliver complete, usable features incrementally
- Each analyzer will have its own visualization components and Streamlit integration
- We'll leverage common base classes to promote code reuse
- Cross-analyzer integration will be handled via facade patterns

## Project Organization
- `src/`: Core source code
- `tests/`: Test files and sample data
- `agent_notes/`: Project documentation
  - `techspec.md`: Original technical specification
  - `improved_techspec.md`: Enhanced technical specification based on analysis
  - `performance_techspec.md`: Technical specification for performance analyzer enhancement
  - `notebook.md`: Detailed notes about data structure and implementation
  - `project_checklist.md`: Task tracking

## Implementation Details
- The parser transforms the log data into a set of structured DataFrames
- It normalizes timestamps, converts numeric values, and establishes relationships
- It categorizes events into specialized collections (combat, economy, item, player)
- It provides DataFrame outputs for analysis
- The analytics framework builds on this structure to derive higher-level insights
- The visualization layer transforms these insights into visual representations
- The Streamlit application provides an interactive interface to explore the data

## Working With This Project
For future agent sessions, focus on the following approach:
1. Understand the data model through `notebook.md` and model definitions
2. Run the test parser to see how the data is transformed and structured
3. When adding new features, follow the existing architectural patterns
4. Ensure comprehensive testing of any new capabilities
5. Update documentation to reflect new functionality

The key challenge in this project is handling the heterogeneous data structure while providing a unified analytical framework. The star schema-inspired approach with specialized views has proven effective for this purpose. 

## Recent Changes: Integrated Development Approach (March 2025)
We've adopted a more integrated development approach:
- For each analyzer, we will now complete the entire pipeline:
  1. Core analyzer implementation with comprehensive metrics
  2. Visualization framework specific to that analyzer
  3. Streamlit dashboard integration for that analyzer
- This approach provides several benefits:
  - Delivers complete, usable features incrementally
  - Allows for faster feedback and iteration
  - Ensures consistent patterns across analyzers
  - Provides better alignment between metrics and visualizations

## PerformanceAnalyzer Enhancement Plan (March 2025)
We're currently enhancing the PerformanceAnalyzer with:
- Additional efficiency metrics:
  - Damage efficiency (damage/gold)
  - Gold efficiency (gold/minute)
  - Combat contribution percentages
  - Survival efficiency metrics
  - Target prioritization analysis
- Comparative metrics:
  - Performance vs. match average
  - Role-specific benchmarking
  - Team contribution analysis
- Visualization components:
  - KDA comparison charts
  - Damage distribution visualizations
  - Gold and economy tracking
  - Performance overview diagrams
- Streamlit integration:
  - Performance dashboard page
  - Interactive filtering
  - Metric exploration components
  - Comparative analysis views

Example usage of enhanced PerformanceAnalyzer:
```python
from src.parser import CombatLogParser
from src.analytics.performance import PerformanceAnalyzer
from src.visualization.performance import PerformanceVisualizer

# Parse the log file
parser = CombatLogParser()
parser.parse("CombatLogExample.log")

# Create an analyzer with default configuration
analyzer = PerformanceAnalyzer(parser)

# Get efficiency metrics
efficiency_df = analyzer.get_efficiency_metrics()

# Get comparative metrics
comparison_df = analyzer.get_comparative_metrics()

# Create visualizations
visualizer = PerformanceVisualizer(analyzer)
kda_fig = visualizer.create_kda_chart().generate()
damage_fig = visualizer.create_damage_distribution().generate()

# Export all visualizations
visualizer.generate_all(output_dir="output", formats=["png", "svg"])
```

## Performance Analyzer Enhancement and Streamlit Dashboard Implementation (March 21, 2025)

Today, we made significant progress on both the Performance Analyzer enhancement and the Streamlit Dashboard implementation:

### 1. Performance Analyzer Enhancements

We successfully implemented the enhanced PerformanceAnalyzer with the following additional metrics:

#### Efficiency Metrics
- **Damage efficiency**: Damage dealt per gold spent
- **Gold efficiency**: Gold earned per minute
- **Combat contribution**: Player damage as a percentage of team total
- **Survival efficiency**: (Kills + Assists) / Deaths with weighted coefficients
- **Target prioritization**: Percentage of damage dealt to high-priority targets

#### Comparative Metrics
- **Performance vs. average**: Compare player metrics against match average
- **Role benchmarking**: Compare metrics against role-specific benchmarks (when role data is available)
- **Team contribution**: Percentage contribution to team's total performance

#### Advanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage missing or incomplete data
- Implemented default values and column verification for robustness
- Enhanced validation of input data and configuration options

#### Testing Framework
- Added unit tests for all new metrics
- Created test cases with mock data to verify calculations
- Ensured compatibility with existing metrics
- Fixed test failures and edge cases

### 2. Streamlit Dashboard Implementation

We've developed a complete Streamlit dashboard for the PerformanceAnalyzer:

#### Dashboard Structure
- Created a modular, well-organized directory structure:
  ```
  streamlit/
    app.py                # Main application entry point
    pages/
      home.py             # Home/dashboard page
      performance.py      # Performance analysis page
    components/
      sidebar/            # Sidebar components
      metrics/            # Metrics display components
    utils/
      session.py          # Session state management
    assets/
      styles.css          # Custom styling
  ```

#### Performance Analysis Page
- Created a tabbed interface for different metric categories:
  - Overview: KDA metrics and top performers
  - Damage Analysis: Damage metrics and distribution charts
  - Healing Analysis: Healing metrics and comparison charts
  - Economy: Gold and resource metrics and breakdowns
  - Efficiency: Advanced efficiency metrics and comparative visualizations

#### Interactive Features
- Implemented filtering by player, team, and minimum damage
- Created metric display components with smart formatting
- Added dynamic visualizations based on available data
- Implemented responsive UI with proper error handling

#### Practical Features
- File uploader for CombatLog files
- Navigation between different analyzers
- Match information display
- Configuration controls in the sidebar

### 3. Next Steps

The following items remain to be completed to finalize the Performance Analyzer implementation:

1. Additional visualizations integration into the dashboard
2. Export functionality for analysis results
3. Dashboard performance optimization
4. Comprehensive Streamlit component testing

Once these items are completed, we'll move on to the next analyzer in our roadmap: the Farm Analyzer. 

## Current Status: Test Infrastructure and Bug Fixing (March 22, 2025)

We're currently addressing several test failures in the codebase after implementing the enhanced PerformanceAnalyzer and visualization framework. Here's our current status:

### Test Failures Summary

1. **PerformanceAnalyzer Tests** (9 tests failing):
   - Main issue: `analyze()` method is returning lists instead of DataFrames
   - Efficiency metrics calculation has issues with missing columns
   - Comparative metrics implementation is not working properly
   - KDA calculation is inconsistent with test expectations
   - Top performers calculation has incorrect sorting

2. **Streamlit UI Tests** (1 test failing):
   - `test_sidebar_file_upload` is failing because `get_or_create_analyzer` is not being called
   - Issue is in sidebar component integration with the core SDK

3. **Test Parser Tests** (1 test missing fixture):
   - Test parser test is missing a fixture

### Current Architecture Issues

We've identified several architectural issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Too much logic in Streamlit UI layer
   - Validation should be in SDK, not UI

2. **Data Flow**:
   - SDK should provide complete, pre-formatted data
   - Analyzers should return DataFrames, not lists

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Inconsistent error handling across components
   - Need better defensive programming

### Implementation Plan

1. **Fix PerformanceAnalyzer Tests**:
   - Modify `analyze()` method to return DataFrames instead of lists
   - Implement proper defensive programming for efficiency metrics
   - Fix comparative metrics implementation
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout

2. **Fix Streamlit UI Tests**:
   - Update sidebar component to ensure analyzer creation
   - Fix integration with updated SDK interfaces

3. **Enhance Debug Infrastructure**:
   - Add comprehensive logging for all components
   - Create a centralized error handling system
   - Implement test coverage reporting

4. **Complete SDK-Centric Architecture**:
   - Move all validation logic to SDK
   - Create standard chart generation in SDK
   - Enhance PerformanceAnalyzer with defensive programming
   - Improve visualization module with pre-formatted data

This approach will ensure that our architecture maintains the proper separation of concerns, with the SDK handling all data processing and validation, and the UI focused on presentation.
